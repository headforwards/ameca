	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		This is a <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit">SvelteKit</a> app. 
		It's purpose it to create a safe space for browser automation testing.
	</p>
	<p> And you'll be using <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>  to try and beat the target practice game, or solve your way through the puzzle room!</p>

	<h3>What is Svelte?</h3>
	<p>
		Svelte is a tool for building web applications. Like other user interface frameworks, it allows you to build your app declaratively out of components that combine markup, styles and behaviours.
	</p>
	<p>
		These components are compiled into small, efficient JavaScript modules that eliminate overhead traditionally associated with UI frameworks.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can build your entire app with Svelte (for example, using an application framework like SvelteKit), or you can add it incrementally to an existing codebase. You can also ship components as standalone packages that work anywhere.
	</p>

	<h3>What is Cypress?</h3>
	<p>Cypress is a modern testing framework that runs tests directly in the browser, allowing developers to write end-to-end tests that simulate real user interactions. Its unique architecture eliminates common testing pain points like async waits and cross-origin restrictions.</p>
	<p>The framework excels in providing immediate visual feedback during test authoring and execution. Developers can see exactly what happened at each step, with time-travel debugging and automatic video recordings of test runs, making it easier to diagnose failures.</p>
	<p>Cypress integrates seamlessly with continuous integration pipelines and offers powerful features like network traffic control, stub responses, and spy functions. Its API is designed to be simple yet powerful, automatically handling common scenarios like waiting for elements to appear or network requests to complete.</p>
